READABLE RIDDLE IN RUBY
=========================

I absolutely promise you that this code is completely useless to you unless you still need convincing about how readable ruby can be!

This is purely an exercise in readable ruby code, but more accurately
it's just a bit of fun as I try to master this wonderful language!

For a full explanation as to why I did this, check out the accompanying blog article;

In that article you'll find an open challenge to pull this code and get it to solve any of the other possible solutions to this riddle. I truly believe that any solution is possible with minimal changes to the existing code. Bored? Give it a try :)
